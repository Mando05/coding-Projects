Collards,"Collard greens are nutritional rock stars loaded with beneficial phytonutrients, vitamins and minerals. Rich in antioxidants, B vitamins and important minerals. An excellent choice for heart health. Sulfurous phytonutrients (glucosinolates and cysteine sulfoxides) inhibit growth of many types of cancers. Some stimulate liver to produce detoxification enzymes that work synergistically to speed up removing free radicals and toxins. Vitamins and minerals promote cardiovascular, immune system, brain and overall health through direct interactions and antioxidant effects. Provide antioxidant vitamins A, C and E. Vitamin C protects water-soluble areas (inside and outside of cells). Vitamins A and E protect fatty molecules and structures, together protecting cell machinery (proteins, enzymes, cell membranes, DNA, mitochondria). Free radicals oxidize cholesterol, which converts to a form that sticks to blood vessel walls (initiating plaque buildup). Vitamin A and zinc help maintain healthy epithelial cells (skin, mucus membranes, gastrointestinal tract, vaginal epithelium), the first line of defense against infection. Folate and other B vitamins moderate homocysteine level in blood by converting to safe form. Potassium and magnesium help reduce elevated blood pressure. Manganese is enzyme cofactor (activator) and integral part of enzymes that make vitamin C useable. Also facilitates antioxidant superoxide dismutase, protecting mitochondria from free radical byproducts. Calcium, essential for healthy bone, also helps prevent menopausal bone loss, migraines, PMS symptoms and helps protect colon cells from carcinogens. Dietary fiber promotes smooth, healthy digestion, helps regulate blood sugar and lowers elevated cholesterol.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Collard-greens-iStock-467461187.jpg
Corn,"More than just a source of starch and carbohydrates. Corn contributes to heart health, lung health, energy production, metabolism and memory. Yellow corn higher in carotene lutein than white corn, hence yellow color. Lutein great for eyes. B vitamin folate helps prevent birth defects and lowers homocysteine in blood, a molecule linked to cardiovascular problems. Phytonutrient beta-cryptoxanthin found in corn (also oranges and red bell peppers) may protect lungs from carcinogens. B vitamin pantothenic acid helps maintain energy by breaking down carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Thiamin helps provide energy and contributes to brain health by helping synthesize acetylcholine, a crucial neurotransmitter for memory and neural function in general.

Diuretic components cause kidneys to produce more urine, removing excess toxins, lowering high blood sugar and lowering blood pressure.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Dandelion-iStock-1398374647.jpg
Dill,"The significant health benefits of dill come from unique phytonutrients, including monoterpenes (carvone, anethofuran, and limonene) and flavonoids (kaempferol and vicenin). Monoterpenes activate the antioxidant enzyme glutathione-S-transferase, which marks dangerous free radicals for destruction by other compounds. Dill’s volatile oil has anti-bacterial properties. Like garlic and thyme, dill inhibits the growth of many common bacteria. Dill is also a great addition to dishes for its mineral and fiber content. A good source of calcium, dill contributes to bone maintenance. Its iron helps blood deliver oxygen to tissues. Fiber promotes smooth digestion and absorption of nutrients. Munching on dill seed has been used to stop hiccups. Making tea with dill is a popular cure for indigestion.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Dill-iStock-1153260660.jpg
Eggplant,"Eggplant has a nice mixture of vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients. Many of the phytonutrients, like phenolic compounds and flavonoids, are antioxidants. One flavonoid, nasunin, protects the membranes around each cell. Especially important because cell membranes control traffic in and out of each cell, contain receptors for messenger compounds that tell the cell what to do and are the protective barrier between inside and outside. Among phenolic compounds, chlorogenic acid is a potent antioxidant in highest concentrations. With flavonoids, these compounds disarm free radicals in many locations to help stop oxidative cell damage (which could develop into cancer), help relax blood vessels, lower cholesterol and plaque buildup, help ward off microbes and viruses and reduce free-radical stress in joints, a primary part of arthritis development. Eggplant also has fiber, potassium and several B vitamins to help promote healthy metabolism, digestion and nerve/muscle function. All these benefits are low-cost, because eggplant is low in fat and sugar.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Eggplant-iStock-827754952.jpg
Endive,"Endive is particularly rich in vitamin K, which is essential for several proteins that make blood clot. (The name K comes from the German word koagulation.) If blood does not clot, wounds bleed out of control. Vitamin K plays an important role in bone formation. Many foods contain vitamin K, and a deficiency is rare. Endive is also a good source of vitamin A, folate and fiber. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble antioxidant that clears destructive free radicals and helps maintain healthy epithelial tissue around blood vessels and organs such as the liver and stomach. Folate protects blood vessel walls from early damage that can lead to stroke and heart attack. Folate converts the molecule homocysteine into harmless molecules used for other purposes. Folate also helps with cell growth and normal fetal development, making it essential during pregnancy. It also aids digestion by stimulating alkaline bile, which may help balance intestinal pH like a mild antacid.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Endive-iStock-953762382.jpg
Fennel,"Fennel has promising phytonutrients with potent antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory properties, and the ability to inhibit cancer cell development (according to early research). Most notable is phytonutrient anethole. In animal studies, anethole reduced inflammation and blocked the initiation of cancer cells through the inhibition of one or more biochemical pathways. Fennel is a great way to get vitamin C, potassium, folate and fiber. Vitamin C is a versatile antioxidant. It protects cells in water-soluble areas from free radical damage that can lead to arthritis and atherosclerosis. It may also be needed by the immune system for optimum function against harmful invaders. Fiber, folate and potassium together are great for the digestive tract and cardiovascular system. Fiber helps the intestines and lowers elevated levels of cholesterol and blood sugar. Folate prevents the buildup of homocysteine in the blood, a compound known to cause vessel damage in high concentrations. Fennel has potassium as well, which promotes healthy nerve and muscle functions and helps lower blood pressure.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Fennel-Stock-117642818.jpg
Figs,"Figs are a great source of potassium, which supports healthy nerve function and muscle contraction. A diet with many potassium-rich fruits and vegetables is linked to lower blood pressure compared to diets with little potassium. Figs have little calcium, but their potassium helps decrease the amount of calcium lost in urine, which makes figs a net supporter of bone health. The dietary fiber promotes healthy digestion, regulates cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and may support weight loss. Research on the benefits of fig leaves suggests phytonutrients within the leaves can help lower the amount of insulin needed by dependent diabetics. They may also reduce triglycerides in blood and inhibit the growth of some cancers. Watch for future discoveries of the health benefits linked to fig trees.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Figs-iStock-1418844327.jpg
Garlic,"Garlic, an antioxidant, slows plaque buildup (calcification) in coronary arteries. Studies show it stops calcium from binding with proteoheparan, (and then with LDL cholesterol) which begins the process. Slowing plaque buildup lowers the risk of later heart attack. Helps lower blood pressure and suppresses or removes oxidizing agents in blood stream and fat areas. Contains organosulphur compounds (ex. allicin and diallyl disulphide) that have antiviral and strong antibacterial activity, making garlic excellent for treating common colds. Compounds also help relax and enlarge blood vessels, which can help lower blood pressure and improve blood flow. These phytonutrients in garlic also show strong anti-carcinogen effects.

Antioxidant reducing free radicals associated with inflammation, high cholesterol and cardiovascular disease. Pink grapefruit among the highest in antioxidants. Studies of antioxidant lycopene suggest regular eating can dramatically lower risk of prostate cancer. Many other phytonutrients with great potential benefits. Compounds called limonoids trigger production of detoxifying liver enzymes. Bonus: Limonoids stay active in body up to 24 hours, making them more potent fighter of many toxins, many of which could be carcinogenic. Red and blond grapefruit contain soluble fiber, pectin, that reduces bad form of cholesterol (LDL) and triglycerides, providing cardiovascular benefits by preventing buildup in arteries. Regular eating of high-C foods (juices of grapefruit, apple and orange) lowers risk of forming calcium oxalate (kidney) stones.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Grapefruit-iStock-472658742.jpg
Grapes,"Recent extensive research suggests most beneficial attributes may lie in their phytonutrients rather than vitamins and minerals. Most notable phytonutrients may be polyphenols, which include flavonoids and phenolic acids. Flavonoids quercetin and resveratrol help prevent free radicals from oxidizing the bad type of cholesterol (LDL), turning it into a form that later leads to arterial damage and plaque buildup. They maintain normal blood vessel dilation and prevent blood clots that can cause strokes. Contain saponins, believed to reduce absorption of cholesterol and slow the biochemical pathways leading to inflammation. Resveratrol and others play a large role in both of those health benefits and also prevent the secretion of the hormone angiotensin II, which can lead to stiffening of the heart. Contain pterostilbene, a promising compound for metabolizing fats, including cholesterol. Resveratrol, highly concentrated in red wine, is antibacterial and antifungal, making grapes a good fighter of food borne illness. Antioxidant action ditches free radicals and optimizes health of circulatory system, making grapes a great promoter of overall health. Nutrients available several ways: eating grapes fresh, drinking wine and juice or eating toast with grape jam.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Grapes-iStock-1172850473.jpg
Guava,"Loaded with vitamin C (more than double the RDA per fruit) and beneficial phytonutrients. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that prevents damage to many cells, organs and tissues such as eyes, blood vessels, heart and immune system. Full dose of vitamin C in one fruit assures water-soluble areas get protection from free radicals and that immune cells are active. High in lycopene, a powerful antioxidant known to reduce oxidative damage in cells. May also inhibit growth of some types of cancer cells. (Undergoing extensive research.) Fiber and potassium enable guava to lower blood pressure, blood glucose, plaque buildup in blood vessels, cholesterol and triglycerides while promoting smooth digestion.

Horseradish,"Horseradish contains glucosinolates (ex. isothiocyanate), potent phytonutrients promoting synthesis of compounds that fight cancer and suppress synthesis of compounds fueling cancer cell growth. Research suggests effects come not from isothiocyanate alone, but from synergistic action with other vegetables containing isothiocyanate. Also linked with increasing blood flow in infected areas and increasing liver’s ability to detoxify. Many people use its antimicrobial properties as remedy for cold, flu and fever. Here’s how: Blend or grind up tablespoon of fresh horseradish and add to boiling water. Steep for about 5 minutes. Drink this brew 2-3 times per day for fever relief. Can be an effective nasal decongestant by adding to food or eating straight. (Watch out for strong taste.) Excellent source of vitamin C and a little fiber. Small amounts of other vitamins and minerals.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Horseradish-iStock-894405444.jpg
Kale,"Kale is highly nutritious, with large variety of vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients. An ideal, all-in-one vegetable to add to your regular diet. Phytonutrients containing sulfur help activate detoxifying enzymes, which act synergistically to remove potentially toxic/carcinogenic chemicals. Other phyotchemicals in crucifers, like glucosinolates, metabolize to isothiocyanates, which inhibit development of many cancer cells. Great for vision. Carotenoids, like lutein and zeaxanthin, along with beta-carotene and vitamins A and C, protect from damaging free radicals and ultraviolet light. Antioxidant action of vitamins A and C help boost immune system, protect blood vessels, reduce inflammation and protect epithelial cells (skin and lining of internal organs). Vitamin K with calcium enhances bone-forming processes and helps prevent bone loss. Trace mineral manganese, along with the B vitamins, helps metabolize sugars, carbohydrates, proteins and lipids to produce energy. Eating leafy vegetables has been shown to extend cognitive function for years longer among elders. Excellent source of fiber, which promotes healthy digestion and regulates cholesterol and blood sugar levels.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Kale-iStock-899247492.jpg
Kiwi,"Kiwi fruit contain a solid mix of vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients for a daily health boost. Research is still ongoing, but certain phytonutrients (probably carotenoids and flavonoids) in kiwi can decrease oxygen-related damage to DNA. Damage to DNA molecules can cause mutations that interfere with proteins and enzymes vital to all cellular functions. Studies show eating kiwis or other citrus fruits lowers the risk of respiratory problems. Highly concentrated source of natural vitamin C, the primary water-soluble antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals causing cellular damage, most notably in cardiovascular system, respiratory system, joints and immune cells. Fat-soluble antioxidant vitamin E gives some protection to fatty areas of the body. Good source of fiber, which reduces high blood sugar and cholesterol levels and helps remove toxins from the colon. The minerals in kiwi (magnesium, potassium and copper) support cardiovascular health. Some work individually, others synergistically, to reduce blood clotting, plaque buildup, triglyceride levels and blood pressure.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Kiwi-iStock-493890436.jpg
Lavender,"The soothing aroma in lavender plants alone is enough to calm the nerves after a tough day. Many say having the fragrance sprayed (or placed using the plant itself) on their pillow or in the bed linen gives headache relief and better sleep. Scientific studies support this phenomenon. Making it into a tea or extracting the oil can provide similar medicinal properties, such as reducing stress, anxiety, nervousness and nausea. Lavender’s fragrance and soothing effects can be a great addition to body, bath and cleaning products. Lavender’s essential oil has antibacterial and antifungal action. Lavender oil is great to have for applying to dressing of wounds and burns. Can be used for cooking to add a bit of flavor. Some create lavender sugar by leaving in a sugar container for a couple weeks. You can also grind it up and use it to bake or give flavor to anything you think needs it.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Lavender-iStock-1332006002.jpg
Leeks,"Leeks are in the Allium family and carry some of the same health benefits as garlic and onions. (See Garlic and Onion entries for the benefits of phytonutrients in this family.) Leeks differ from their family members in giving fewer nutrients per weight. Because they are less concentrated, you must eat more to get the same nutrition. Compared to garlic and onion, this is easy considering how mellow and sweet their taste is. In general, regular eating of veggies in the Allium family is linked with lower bad cholesterol concentrations and preventing or inhibiting the growth or spread of cancer. With a small dose of vitamin C, iron, folate and B6, leeks add a few antioxidants to get rid of dangerous free radicals, help activate hemoglobin molecules for oxygen transport, lower high levels of the compound homocysteine (damages blood vessels at high concentrations), and helps the body metabolize food to provide energy.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Leeks-iStock-638289212.jpg
Lemon Grass,"Including lemon grass in your garden provides many benefits. Making tea with the stems helps digestion, promotes a calm night’s sleep, reduces anxiety, eases headaches and even has antimicrobial abilities to fight some infections. It may help with respiratory problems and provide some calming effects as well. Adding lemongrass to the bath will help clear up oily skin. Lemon grass citronella oil is a natural, effective mosquito repellent. To get the oil directly from the plant, break off a stalk and peel off the outer leaves until you find a scallion-like stem at the base. Bend and rub with your palms until it turns juicy. Then rub thoroughly over exposed skin. Planting these plants around the patio will help deter mosquitoes. Lemon grass is able to repel fleas and ticks in the same way. If you are walking your dog through deep grasses, lemon grass can be a quick help for both of you. As a detoxifying agent, lemon grass has a diuretic effect (causing more urination) which helps flush out the kidney, liver, pancreas, bladder and digestive tract. Loaded with beneficial minerals, which can lower blood pressure, maintain healthy nerve/muscle function and act as co-factors for enzymes with many diverse functions.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Lemon-Grass-iStock-1134579077.jpg
Lemons & Limes,"A great source of vitamin C and other phytonutrients, similar to other popular fruits and veggies. Vitamin C is the great immune booster and antioxidant that knocks out free radicals at the top of the inflammatory cascade. Helps reduce symptoms of inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Acting against free radicals, vitamin C can assist in cardiovascular health by preventing the oxidation of cholesterol, a step toward plaque buildup. Lemons and limes both have flavonoid compounds that act as antioxidants, too. Both help sterilize some foods by killing off bacteria. Citrus fruits also contain limonoids that fight a number of cancers and potentially lower cholesterol.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Lemon-Lime-iStock-1215625071.jpg
Lettuce,"Loaded with good stuff: Vitamins K, A, C, folate and manganese. Romaine especially supports cardiovascular health. Vitamins A and C help prevent arterial plaque buildup by eliminating free radicals that oxidize cholesterol and help keep arterial walls elastic. Fiber helps regulate cholesterol levels and promotes healthy digestion. Romaine lettuce’s potassium may help reduce blood pressure and promote the proper firing of muscle and nerve cells. Folate helps prevent damage to blood vessel walls by lowering homocysteine concentration in blood. Folate also is essential for proper nerve development in fetuses. A few ounces of romaine lettuce give more than 100 percent RDA of vitamin K, which helps in making thicker bones. To help avoid lethargy, B vitamins and manganese in romaine help the body extract energy from food.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Lettuce-Stock-182848247.jpg
Licorice,"The phytonutrients in licorice have been used for centuries as a natural remedy for many common ailments. Prepare as a tea, make lozenges or simply chew on the root. Stores carry it as an extract, powder or loose leaves. Many use it to help aid digestive problems, like indigestion, heartburn and irregularity; has mild laxative properties. May help produce energy and increase stamina. Most popular use is to relieve chest congestion, coughs or sore throats. Glycoside stimulates production of thin mucus in membranes of stomach and respiratory tract and helps clear out lungs and throat. Useful as a soothing skin ointment. Has antimicrobial properties (including antiviral and antibacterial). Inhibits the hepatitis virus. Some women use licorice root as a dietary supplement to relieve premenstrual syndrome and symptoms of menopause. Research suggests this effect comes from preventing spikes in estrogen levels. May also help decrease mood swings and hot flashes. Not to be used during pregnancy, because it is linked to increased risk of premature labor. Side effects of prolonged use include water retention and lower potassium levels. Use caution and consult physician if you have high blood pressure or heart disease.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Licorice-iStock-1057753600.jpg
Loquat,"A great fruit low in saturated fat and sodium while high in a few vitamins, minerals and fiber. Good to eat while trying to lose weight. Vitamin A, a protective antioxidant, promotes eyesight, especially night vision. Also helps maintain healthy teeth, immune system, and skeletal and soft tissue (skin and membranes around organs). Fiber adds bulk to a meal, giving a full feeling faster that may help control weight. Promotes smooth digestion and lowers elevated cholesterol and blood sugar. B vitamins are necessary to encourage the breakdown (catabolism) and buildup (anabolism) of compounds in foods and vital nutrients needed for healthy function, respectively. Vitamin B6 helps immune system produce antibodies and break down proteins. Vitamin B12 helps form red blood cells and, with potassium, helps maintain healthy nerve function. Potassium also reduces elevated blood pressure and helps maintain proper functioning of muscle cells. Manganese is an important cofactor for enzymes involved with many functions like disarming free radicals, forming bone/cartilage, metabolism and wound healing.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Loquat-iStock-472593136.jpg
Majoram,"See Oregano for vitamin, mineral and fiber health benefits. Main difference between marjoram and oregano is in their essential oils, although the effects of the oils overlap. The chemical compounds in marjoram essential oil are primarily pinene, sabinene, camphor, borneol and origanol. The oil has anti-bacterial/viral properties. It also helps ease pain, calms the mood, promotes sleep, aids digestion and lowers blood pressure. Some use it as a diuretic or expectorant. Used to treat migraines, headaches, arthritis, asthma, respiratory infections, depression, anxiety, insomnia, constipation and stress.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Majoram-iStock-1334324195.jpg
Mango,"Mangoes are a great source of powerful antioxidants such as beta-carotene, vitamin C, quercetin and astragalin. They combine to neutralize free radicals, which can damage cells in the form of DNA mutations that lead to uncontrolled cell division, i.e. cancer. The antioxidants zeaxanthin and lutein help stop age-related macular degeneration in the eye. Vitamin C helps the immune system and assists in preventing cataracts. The soluble fiber, pectin, lowers cholesterol, promotes healthy digestion and cardiovascular function. Pectin also helps reduce the risk of gastrointestinal cancer. The high iron content helps women recover after menstruation and assists during pregnancy. High potassium helps maintain healthy nerve signal transmission and muscle contraction. Contain proteolytic enzymes that help break down proteins and work with fiber for healthy digestion.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Mango-iStock-904619712.jpg
Melons (Cantaloupe & Honeydew),"Cantaloupe is rich in vitamins A, C and beta-carotene. (More than 100 percent of RDA in one cup.) Vitamin A and beta-carotene essential to maintain healthy vision. Vitamin C protects circulatory and immune systems from cell-damaging free radicals and stimulates white blood cells to fight infection. (Honeydew has much less of the vitamins but similar amounts of the others.) Also contains folate, important in producing and maintaining new cells, especially during pregnancy or when healing a severe wound. Cantaloupe helps with energy by controlling metabolism of carbohydrates.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Melons2-iStock-1291607543.jpg
Mint (peppermint),"Many varieties of mint, all with similar health benefits. Peppermint adds little in vitamins and minerals, but phytonutrients give excellent remedies. Peppermint oil has phytonutrients that help relax smooth muscles (the muscles lining internal organs and blood vessels), which help control symptoms of dyspepsia or indigestion. Also inhibits growth of many common harmful bacteria and fungi. Research suggests the phytonutrient perillyl alcohol can stop the growth of many types of cancers. Peppermint contains phytonutrient rosmarinic acid, an antioxidant. It also blocks some chemicals of inflammatory response. Eaten in high quantities, mint is a rich source of all nutrients below and has other health benefits through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer actions. Promotes bone health and overall wellness.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Peppermint-iStock-480770684.jpg
Mustard,"Mustard greens are loaded with vitamin K, which increases bone formation and decreases its breakdown (osteoclastic processes). Especially helpful for postmenopausal women. Magnesium also an important cofactor for many enzymes, some involved with bone and cartilage building. (Others keep smooth muscles relaxed, which helps asthmatics.) With some calcium, mustard greens are good for bones. Great source of vitamin A and a good source of vitamin C. Besides being a protective antioxidant, vitamin A helps maintain healthy eyesight in low light, embryonic development and immune system function by helping develop and activate red and white blood cells. Vitamin A also helps increase blood vessel dilation and decrease blood vessel spasms. Antioxidant vitamin C protects water-soluble areas from cellular damage by free radicals. Also important in synthesis of collagen (part of blood vessels), ligaments, tendons and bone formation. (May also promote healthy immune system function, but more research is needed.) Together, antioxidant vitamins A, C and E help blood vessels relax and prevent plaque buildup. Folate is involved with DNA synthesis and protein catabolism. Folate also regulates homocysteine in the blood. (At excess levels, homocysteine is linked to hardening of blood vessels, which leads to heart disease.) Folate is also essential to proper fetal development. Mustard greens have many phytonutrients (e.g. glucosinolates) that get converted to isothiocyanates. These are being researched for their ability to inhibit cancer cell growth and stimulate production of detoxifying enzymes in the liver.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/mustard-iStock-1141736155.jpg
Nectarines,"Nectarines have high content of carotenoids and flavonoids, including phytonutrients lutein and lycopene, both supporters of healthy vision, heart health and the fight against carcinogens. Vitamins C and A also support immune system response to unwanted bacteria, viruses and fungi. Vitamins E and A help protect skin from UV or free radical damage and helps maintain elasticity in the inner lining of blood vessels. Nectarines give a good dose of dietary fiber, which works to promote healthy digestion and nutrient absorption from food and drink. Fiber helps balance cholesterol levels and prevents buildup of bad cholesterol. Very low in total calorie content, fat free and great source of natural sugars.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Nectarines-iStock-1253630166.jpg
Okra,"Okra is a powerful source of both soluble and insoluble fiber. The soluble fiber, in the forms of gums and pectins, lowers total cholesterol, mainly LDL (the bad form). It also helps regulate digestion, which moderates spikes in blood sugar levels. Soluble fiber puts less stress on insulin producing cells and could help prevent Type II diabetes. Insoluble fibers in okra help maintain intestinal health. They bind to wastes (some of which are toxic or contain cholesterol), absorb water and keep things flowing smoothly in the intestines. They also delay absorption of glucose and promote colon health by balancing pH levels. Okra’s high quality fiber helps feed beneficial bacteria in the intestines, contributing to more efficient breakdown of food and nutrient absorption. Okra’s vitamin K contributes to blood clotting and strong, healthy bones. Also low in calories, which makes it ideal for eating healthy while losing weight.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Okra-iStock-805667710.jpg
Olives,"Olives are a great source of the fat-soluble antioxidant vitamin E, which helps protect fat-based areas of the body. They also have monounsaturated fats, which resist oxidative damage by free radicals much better than polyunsaturated fats. Olives also contain proactive phytonutrients including polyphenols and flavonoids, both having antioxidant and anti-inflammatory roles. They help protect cells from free radical damage that could lead to heart disease or colon cancer. The anti-inflammatory properties may also reduce pain or recovery time for “red and sore” conditions. Olives have iron and dietary fiber, too. The iron helps hemoglobin in the blood bind oxygen in the lungs for delivery to all tissues. Fiber promotes smooth digestion, helps lower excess cholesterol and regulates blood sugar levels.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Olives-iStock-1441226989.jpg
Onions,"Onions have a dense collection of phytonutrients that give many health benefits. These include powerful sulfur-containing molecules like allyl propyl disulfide and a multitude of flavonoids including quercetin. Eating onions can help increase efficient processing of free-floating glucose in the body. Allyl propyl raises free-floating insulin in the blood by preventing it from becoming inactivated in the liver. Chromium also decreases blood sugar by making cells more responsive to insulin, resulting in cellular glucose uptake. Onions are also heart healthy by reducing the amount of cholesterol and homocysteine in the blood, both linked to heart problems. Quercetin is an antioxidant that benefits the colon by protecting against carcinogens. Another onion compound blocks osteoclasts (cells that break down bone), which is beneficial for elders whose bone production has slowed. Vitamin C, quercetin and isothiocyanates reduce joint swelling.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Onions-Stock-513468531.jpg
Oranges & Tangerines,"Besides high vitamin C, oranges contain flavanoids under the sub-category flavanones. The flavanone herperidin, in animal studies, has shown it can lower blood pressure, cholesterol and inflammation. This flavanone and others are found mostly in the peel and pulp of the orange rather than the juice. Thus, you can be less meticulous about removing all the peel before eating. Vitamin C is vital in protecting cells in the immune system and disarming aqueous free radicals that cause cell damage (potentially carcinogenic DNA mutations). Compounds known as limonoids remain active for extended periods. Along with folate, potassium, fiber and many phytonutrients, citrus fruits are antioxidant, anti-allergenic, anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory. They also help lower blood pressure, promote proper digestion and prevent kidney stones.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Oranges-iStock-1493917402.jpg
Oregano,"Contains the potent volatile oils thymol and carvacrol, known to have antibacterial action stronger than some prescriptions. Thymol and rosmarinic acid are effective antioxidants, helping to eliminate cell-damaging free radicals. Oregano is also a great source of some minerals and vitamins, especially vitamin K. This often-overlooked vitamin may help promote heart health by helping to keep calcium from forming plaque in arteries. It also promotes bone health and blood clotting.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Oregano-iStock-653084104.jpg
Parsley,"In addition to great plate décor, parsley has excellent potential health benefits. It contains volatile oils such as limonene, myristicin and eugenol and beneficial flavonoids like apiin, apigenin and luteolin. The volatile oils act as anti-carcinogens (in animal studies) and may act similarly in humans. Myristicin activates an enzyme that attaches glutathione to highly reactive molecules (some are carcinogens) neutralizing them. The flavonoids have antioxidant properties and help neutralize oxygen-containing free radicals, preventing them from damaging cellular components (membranes, DNA, enzymes, etc.). Parsley is a great source of vitamins K, C and A. Vitamin K helps maintain a healthy bone matrix and may help prevent some cancers. Vitamin C is an antioxidant protecting cells from damage in water-soluble areas all over the body. Both vitamins C and A strengthen the immune system. Folic acid renders homocysteine in the blood harmless, protecting blood vessel walls from damage.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Parsley-iStock-1411499383.jpg
Parsnips,"Benefits are similar to potatoes. The main difference: parsnips have more fiber and folate but less vitamin C per weight. (Still a great source, with half the RDA of C in one parsnip.) With more dietary fiber, parsnips better support digestion. They help everything flow smoothly, get rid of excess cholesterol and regulate blood sugar. Folate is known to lower homocysteine in the blood, preventing plaque buildup that harms blood vessel structure. Pregnant women need folate to promote healthy fetal nerve development. Also a good source of vitamin K, which helps develop a dense bone matrix. Parsnips have some B vitamins that help boost fat, protein and carbohydrate metabolism to provide energy.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Parsnips-iStock-1270080068.jpg
Peaches,"Peaches are an excellent source of vitamins A and C. Vitamin A is an antioxidant that stabilizes free radicals associated with cancer and other diseases. It also aids proper vision in low light. Vitamin C is famous for its many benefits: healing cuts and abrasions, building connective tissue for muscles and bones, protecting immune system, preventing bruising and helping build new red blood cells. Peaches also contain other vitamins and minerals, including fiber, that aid in proper digestion and help enhance skin color.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Peaches-iStock-485344648.jpg
Pears,"Pears give a solid defense against damaging free radicals and are a great source of dietary fiber. Vitamin C and copper help keep highly reactive free radicals from causing oxidative damage to cells all over the body. Vitamin C is water-soluble and defends almost the entire body except areas of fat. It stops free radicals from oxidizing cholesterol into a sticky form that leads to plaque buildup in blood vessels. It also protects white blood cells while they fight off infection and reactivates antioxidant vitamin E. Because vitamin E is fat soluble, by activating it vitamin C helps disarm free radicals in both water-soluble areas and fat-soluble areas. Dietary fiber in pears acts to reduce cholesterol, regulate blood sugar levels and support good digestion.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Pears-iStock-509255995.jpg
Peas,"Green peas promote overall health with seven vitamins, eight minerals and other phytonutrients. Vitamin K, crucial for bone health, is most abundant in peas. Some of it converts to vitamin K2 and is part of bone mineralization. Deficiency in K2 hinders mineralization and makes osteoporosis more likely. Incompletely researched, folate and vitamin B6 may contribute to bone health by blocking the buildup of homocysteine, a molecule that interrupts proper bone matrix formation. Vitamin K and folate also help the cardiovascular system. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting, while folate and vitamin B6 lower homocysteine, which may reduce damage to arterial walls and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Green peas also contain B vitamins that help break down carbohydrates, fats and proteins for energy. Iron is crucial for blood cell formation and oxygen delivery to muscles. Vitamins C and A protect many types of cells in the eye, liver, immune system, adrenal glands, connective tissue and the circulatory system.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Peas-iStock-1359853951.jpg
Peppers,"All peppers are a great source of vitamins A and C, which eliminate cell-damaging free radicals. Vitamin A also counters the effects of cigarette smoke, which may help prevent lung conditions such as emphysema. Bell peppers have the B vitamins folate and pyridoxine. Both decrease homocysteine in the blood, blocking the start of a process linked with higher cholesterol and risk of heart attack or stroke. Fiber in bell peppers helps maintain healthy heart function by lowering harmful cholesterol. Bell peppers also have a carotenoid lycopene and beta-cryptoxanthin, all linked to lower risk of many cancers when eaten regularly.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Peppers-iStock-1020216906.jpg
Persimmons,"Persimmons are an excellent source of vitamins A and C, dietary fiber and manganese. Vitamins A and C help strengthen the immune system, maintain healthy vision and defend the body against harmful free radicals. Some notable antioxidant properties help reduce inflammation, prevent plaque buildup in blood vessels and maintain the elasticity of the inner lining of organs that have epithelial cells. Their excellent fiber promotes digestive efficiency and helps prevent the buildup of bad (LDL) cholesterol. They are also noted for their tannins, proanthocyanidins and other phytonutrients including beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin, cryptoxanthin, catechins, gallocatechins, betulinic acid and shibuol. All act as protective antioxidants throughout the body. Shibuol is a double-edged sword, however, because it can cause globs to form in the digestive tract. For this reason, wait for persimmons to ripen, and do not eat astringent varieties on an empty stomach. The tannin concentration of shibuol is very low in soft, ripened persimmons. Eating them with food in the stomach mixes them in, and they react less with stomach acids. Proanthocyanidins in the skin are linked to helping metabolic processes within cells, preventing unnecessary blood clots from forming, protecting blood vessel cells from hardening and lowering blood pressure. The nutrient content and value of a persimmon depends on which cultivar you choose and how healthy it develops. For its high antioxidant content, this is a promising fruit for overall health.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Persimmons-iStock-660712114.jpg
Pistachio Nut,"Pistachios are packed with great overall nutrition including phytosterols, polyphenols, other antioxidants (some carotenoids), vitamins, minerals and fiber. They are one of the best nuts to get all of these nutrients, especially since they are low-fat. What they do have is “good fat,” the unsaturated fats (mono- and polyunsaturated). The nutrients in pistachios make them a heart-smart snack. They are rich in the amino acid arginine, which in moderate concentrations can help relax blood vessels. The vitamins B6, B12 and folate reduce elevated levels of homocysteine, known to damage blood vessels when too high. The nut’s potassium helps bring down high blood pressure and maintain proper muscle and nerve function (especially valuable for the heart). The antioxidants protect water-soluble and fat-soluble areas of the body, especially in preventing the oxidation of cholesterol. When oxidized, cholesterol becomes “sticky” and more easily adheres to artery walls, leading to plaque buildup. Antioxidants also protect against oxidative damage to DNA. Since DNA is used continuously to create new proteins, we need to protect it against “corruption” leading to mutation and loss of proper function. Fiber provides many key benefits. It promotes smooth digestion, helps expel potentially toxic substances faster and regulates blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Fiber also gives a quick, long-lasting satisfied feeling that leads to eating less often. Pistachios are a rich source of phytosterols, known to decrease the absorption of cholesterol by 30-40 percent and lower serum cholesterol in the blood. Pistachios may promote visual health from their high carotenoid content. They are also a great source of minerals that serve as cofactors for activating enzymes.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Pistachios-iStock-958551592.jpg
Plums,"Plums are known for a unique group of phytonutrient phenols called neochlorogenic and chlorogenic acid. These phenols help prevent oxidative damage to fats all over the body. They also disarm the free radical superoxide, which is highly reactive and can cause major damage to cells all over the body. Plums increase the absorption of iron, the mineral needed to form hemoglobin, which transports oxygen to every cell. Plums offer a nice dose of dietary fiber to promote healthy digestion. They are also a good source of vitamins A and B2, which contribute to vision, blood vessel health and metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and sugars for energy.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Plums-iStock-1277329335.jpg
Pomegranate,"Pomegranates have many vital vitamins and minerals. They also contain polyphenols, tannins, anthocyanins and ellagic acid, all highly beneficial phytonutrients that lower the risk of many diseases. All act as antioxidants, helping disarm damaging free radicals as they form. Most valuable, these phytonutrients might inhibit the initiation/growth of cancer cells. They also help the immune system with antibacterial, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties. Pomegranates also help thin the blood, increasing blood flow, oxygen delivery to tissues and exchange of compounds to and from organs. Thinning blood and donating antioxidants prevents cholesterol from being converted into a sticky form that begins the process of plaque buildup. The polyphenols and folate help protect and maintain elasticity in the blood vessels, which lightens the pumping load on the heart. Pomegranates are one of the richest sources of dietary fiber among fruits, promoting smooth digestion, regulating blood sugar and lowering high cholesterol. Research shows that pomegranates contain a phytonutrient capable of blocking an enzyme that breaks down cartilage in humans and other animals.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Pomegranates-iStock-1452726943.jpg
Potatoes,"Potatoes are wrongly maligned as a high-carbohydrate starch with little or no nutritional value. Not so. The “problem” with potatoes is how they are often prepared (deep fried in oil) and/or what people put on them (high-fat dairy products and/or bacon bits). Potatoes have many different vitamins and phytonutrients. A crucial one is Vitamin B6, which helps build new cells and assists proper signaling in the brain. B6 also helps give us energy by breaking down carbohydrates during exercise. It also has fiber that helps lower cholesterol and supports digestion.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Potatoes2-iStock-1424580892.jpg
Pumpkin,"We most often see the seeds of large pumpkins around Halloween in late October, but they are full of important nutrients all year round. Ongoing research suggests pumpkin seeds help in maintaining prostate health. (Components in the oil prevent the enlargement caused by over-stimulation from the male hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.) Pumpkin seeds also contain carotenoids and omega-3 fatty acids, which have antioxidant action and are beneficial fats compared to saturated fats. Pumpkin seeds also have magnesium and zinc, two minerals important for calcium uptake and bone building, among other benefits. The seeds are being investigated as potent anti-inflammatory agents. Animal studies show they reduce inflammation without the undesired side effects of fat damage in joint linings. Perhaps most exciting about eating pumpkin seeds: They are rich in phytosterols, molecules thought to lower cholesterol and boost the immune system. More research is needed to be conclusive, but they may also help lower the risk of some cancers.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Pumpkin-iStock-610878486.jpg
Quince,"Quince is a great source of vitamin C and a good source of fiber, potassium and iron. Due to the high pectin content, it is rarely eaten raw. Rather, it is popular for making special jams and, since it holds shape well, is popular for baking, stewing or poaching as a dessert. Rich in fiber, quince aids digestion and lowers elevated blood sugar and cholesterol. Vitamin C helps protect cells (including blood vessel and immune cells) from oxidative damage by free radicals. This makes the immune and circulatory systems function more efficiently and helps maintain the body’s biochemical balance. Some studies suggest the phytonutrients (phenolics) in quince have anti-viral properties.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Quince-Stock-499633610.jpg
Radicchio,"The most significant nutrient in radicchio is vitamin K followed by phytonutrients like anthocyanins. Often overlooked, vitamin K plays an important biochemical role in blood clotting and bone matrix building. It is needed for the activation of many proteins in the clotting process. The overall biochemical processes require more research, but thus far vitamin K appears to help encourage the formation of bone matrix (osteoblastic processes), while discouraging the breakdown of bone (osteoclastic processes). Responsible for the deep red color, anthocyanins are promising phytonutrients that have anti-inflammatory properties and inhibit the growth of pre-malignant cancer cells, induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells, inhibit angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels that feed tumors) and reduce cancer-causing DNA damage.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Radicchio-iStock-1395928953.jpg
Radishes,"Like some other popular fruits and vegetables, radishes offer a substantial dose of vitamin C. Much research has been done on vitamin C’s effects on the immune system, but whether it plays a significant role is disputed. Vitamin C is an effective antioxidant molecule that works in the water-soluble portions of the body to disarm free radicals. Vitamin C helps reduce oxidative stress on blood vessels in the cardiovascular system (leading to plaque buildup) and lung cells. The anti-oxidants also deter free radicals from damaging plasma membranes and DNA, which may help prevent cancer-causing mutations. Vitamin C also works with an antioxidant compound, glutathione peroxidase, to help restore the activity of vitamin E (a fat-soluble vitamin). Vitamin C is an important part of collagen formation involved with healthy bone, skin and connective tissues. Radishes have phytonutrients that help aid digestion (by encouraging bile flow) and stimulate the liver to produce detoxifying enzymes that remove harmful chemicals in the blood. Radishes, both red and daikon, have the phytonutrient myrosinase, which acts as an enzyme to break down other phytonutrients in radishes (glucosinolates) to isothiocyanates. Ongoing research with isothiocyanates suggest these compounds may have strong anti-cancer properties.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Radishes-iStock-531773994.jpg
Raspberries,"Red raspberries are delicious and contain powerful phytonutrients that have antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-carcinogenic properties. Aside from vitamins C and E, the tannin ellagic acids and a collection of flavonoids are the antioxidants in raspberries, (which outdo kiwis, strawberries and tomatoes). These compounds help protect critical cells and organs from damage caused by free radicals. They also have antimicrobial properties that help suppress certain bacterial colonies (and others like fungi). Research studies suggest some of the phytonutrients in raspberries inhibit initiation of, or halt the growth of, certain cancer cells. Both vitamin K and manganese help build bone matrix and are an excellent source of fiber. Raspberries have a fair amount of sugars, but the fiber and B vitamins slow the absorption of sugars and help break them down faster. Fiber plays a large role in a healthy digestive tract and helps regulate cholesterol levels. Raspberries also provide some folate, which reduces damage in blood vessel walls and supports fetal nerve development.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Raspberries-iStock-1328141007.jpg
Rhubarb,"Rhubarb is a great source of dietary fiber and helps resolve indigestion issues with its gentle laxative properties. It may also help lower cholesterol and blood pressure. The potassium supports proper nerve functioning and muscle contraction, including the heart. Vitamin C gives rhubarb antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiallergenic properties. Vitamin K with calcium adds to bone formation and helps prevent bone breakdown. Rhubarb is low in carbohydrates, saturated fat, sodium and cholesterol. It increases metabolic rate, which is excellent for eating while trying to lose weight. Rhubarb has antibacterial and antifungal properties that may help prevent infections. If applied topically, rhubarb prevents staph infection.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Rhubarb-iStock-526289620.jpg
Rosemary,"Rosemary adds wonderful flavor and aroma to potatoes, pork, lamb and chicken. It also adds helpful substance to a meal by exciting the immune system. It increases circulation (especially to the brain) and improves digestion. It has anti-inflammatory agents that might moderate the severity of asthma attacks or other conditions. The essential oil of rosemary, obtained by steeping in boiling water or steam distillation of all parts of the plant, may help improve memory and support healthy adrenal and lymphatic functions. Some people say its role in aromatherapy is unmatched. Some students use it at exam times to help with memory, mental stimulation and calming the nerves. It has also been noted to relieve headaches, soothe sore muscles, clear out nasal passages and help treat skin conditions like eczema, acne and rashes. Users derive these benefits by adding a bit to topical oils/creams, rubbing a few drops on directly or adding to bath water. A couple of drops have been added to shampoos and conditioners to help condition hair. The oil also has some antiseptic properties and is used to treat respiratory allergies, sore throat and flu.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Rosemary-iStock-1404263881.jpg
Rutabaga (Swedes),"Rutabaga is a great source of vitamin C, folate, fiber, potassium and manganese. See Radishes for the many benefits associated with the antioxidant vitamin C. Folate and vitamin B6 help protect blood vessel walls by converting homocysteine into an inert compound. This keeps homocysteine from reaching high levels where it damages blood vessel walls. Folate is also important for pregnant women to support healthy fetal nerve development. Fiber facilitates smooth digestion and slows down the absorption of sugar and cholesterol, helping to reduce and regulate elevated levels of both. Potassium assists in the proper functioning of muscle and nerve fibers. It can also replace some sodium in the blood and bring down elevated blood pressure. Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymes involved in detoxification, most notably superoxide dismutase. We need this antioxidant constantly to reduce oxygen free radicals that result from normal respiration in cell mitochondria. If left unchecked, oxygen free radicals can damage cell membranes, mutate DNA and denature proteins. We need magnesium for bone growth and maintenance.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Rutabaga-Stock-492532143.jpg
Sage,"The benefits of sage lie in its potent phytonutrients and volatile oils. Cousin to rosemary, sage is another source of rosmarinic acid. The acid is easily absorbed in the intestines and is known for its antioxidant properties. Sage is also a great source of flavonoids and two of the most powerful antioxidants, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase. SOD and peroxidase convert strong oxygen free radicals into non-toxic forms. These antioxidant compounds give sage a unique ability to help neutralize toxic forms of oxygen formed during cellular respiration. This in turn prevents oxygen-related damage to cell membranes, vital enzymes and DNA. Some studies suggest sage helps improve cognitive function and memory by preventing the degradation of acetylcholine, a vital neurotransmitter. Sage is also known for antiperspirant, antiseptic, calming and digestive properties. Some commercial antiperspirants contain extracts from sage. Rubbing crushed sage leaves over an open cut or wound can help prevent infection. Regularly eating sage also helps smooth digestion and may help reduce blood sugar levels. In addition to adding sage to your food, you can also prepare a tea with it, which gives a more concentrated dose of the phytonutrients and essential oils.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Sage-iStock-954339802.jpg
Scallions,"These young onions have beneficial phytonutrients like flavonoids and sulfur compounds that work together to lower cholesterol, promote heart health, and suppress inflammation. The flavonoid quercetin may bring a number of benefits, including the antioxidant effect in protecting colon cells. Quercetin, along with vitamin C, strengthens the immune system and works against harmful bacteria and viruses that cause common colds or worse. Vitamin C also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that help deal with arthritis and protect the cardiovascular system from cellular damage and plaque buildup. Vitamin K supports healthy bone development by helping support bone laying components and reducing bone break down by osteoclasts. Also lowers blood pressure. Scallions are a good source of dietary fiber, helping promote healthy digestion and preventing diarrhea. Folate promotes heart health and is critical for healthy fetal nervous system development. Scallions also encourage sweating and urination. In combination with those and the fact that scallions are low in saturated fat, sodium and cholesterol, they are an ideal food to include in a weight loss diet.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Scallions2-iStock-1207065786.jpg
Shallots,"See Onions, which have similar vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Shallots-iStock-867578838.jpg
Spinach,"Spinach is remarkable in the myriad of vitamins, minerals , and phytonutrients it gives in one serving. It contains an important carotenoid and a collection of flavonoids that, in addition to vitamins A and C, act as important antioxidants ridding the body of dangerous free radicals. This prevents plaque build up in artery walls by preventing cholesterol from being oxidized. In the end, this helps protect against serious heart problems. Folate and magnesium in spinach also add to heart health by decreasing plaque build up, arterial wall damage (folate) and blood pressure (magnesium and potassium). Because some nutrients are water soluble and others fat soluble, spinach helps resist the growth of various cancerous cells beyond the first day after its consumption. Moreover, nutrients like calcium and Vitamin K add to creating and maintaining healthy bones. The list keeps going with properties that help reduce inflammation in conditions like osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Eating many green leafy vegetables slows down the decline of mental functioning associated with age. Spinach is also an excellent source of iron for helping hemoglobin in blood deliver oxygen to tissues, and lutein that helps maintain eye health. This super food is a great addition to a meal and an ideal way to promote optimal health. Its effects may be profound.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Spinach-iStock-1179990617.jpg
Squash (Summer),Summer squash adds similar nutrients as winter squash but in smaller amounts. See Squash (Winter) for health benefits.,https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Squash-Summer-iStock-890192178.jpg
Squash (Winter),"Research is limited, though some phytonutrients found in winter squash have been linked with anti-cancer properties in studies of other plants. Winter squash is a good source of all the vitamins and minerals listed. More nutrient-dense than its cousin, the summer squash. Most notable in one serving of winter squash are vitamins A (more than 100 percent RDA) and C (more than 30 percent RDA). These vitamins team up for many functions. They support the immune response of white blood cells toward pathogens. They act as antioxidants in water soluble areas of the body, protecting cells from free radical damage. Some major antioxidant actions help prevent the buildup of plaque in blood vessels, reduce inflammation and help prevent damage to cells in the eye. Winter squash gives potassium, key to maintaining normal blood pressure, nerve cell transmission and muscle contraction. High fiber content supports digestion, removes excess cholesterol and helps regulate blood sugar. Pregnant women need the B vitamin folate for normal fetal neural development. Also contributes to heart health by preventing homocysteine, an amino acid that in high concentrations causes blood vessel stiffening. With other B vitamins, squash helps make energy through the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Squash-Winter-iStock-854474506.jpg
Strawberries,"Loaded with Vitamin C. (A single berry can have up to 20 percent of the RDA.) This antioxidant combined with ellagic acid and anthocyanin helps heal wounds faster, strengthens the immune system and helps delay age-related memory loss. The folate in one serving helps reduce neural tube birth defects and damage to arteries. The fiber helps prevent constipation.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Strawberries-iStock-157473014.jpg
Sunflower,"Providing nearly 100 percent of the vitamin E RDA in ¼ cup, sunflower seeds are an excellent source of the main fat-soluble antioxidant. It helps reduce oxidative damage that can cause plaque build up in the arteries, thickening of arteries and joint inflammation. Of the nuts and seeds, sunflower seeds have one of the highest concentrations of phytosterols, phytonutrients with similar structures to cholesterol and linked to lowering their levels in the blood. Some research evidence shows if we eat a moderate amount of these cholesterol substitutes, they have high potential to reduce the damaging effects of cholesterol. Sunflower seeds are a concentrated source of the intermediary mineral magnesium, which is important for biochemical processes in energy production, the synthesis of essential compounds (proteins, enzymes, DNA, lipids, the antioxidant glutathione), cellular communication (proper muscle, nerve function) and bone matrix formation. A deficiency in magnesium may contribute to higher blood pressure, migraine headaches, muscle spasms/cramps, soreness and fatigue. Selenium is a trace mineral in these seeds that is a cofactor/activator for many enzymes and proteins that help the body maintain healthy DNA, prevent proliferation of cancer cells (by inhibiting growth and inducing apoptosis), and helping detoxify the body by marking dangerous compounds for destruction.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Sunflowers-iStock-1399290115.jpg
Swiss Chard,"Chard is off the high end of the chart with its vitamin and mineral content. One cup gives 700 percent of the RDA of vitamin K, more than 100 percent of vitamin A and 50 percent of vitamin C. It is also an excellent source of magnesium, potassium, iron, fiber and more. The health potential of chard seems endless. The vitamin K, magnesium and calcium in chard give a great boost for more bone building and less bone loss. Vitamin A supports healthy vision, immune system function, lung health and protects thin membrane layers around organs and blood vessels. Minerals in chard can also help keep normal blood pressure while vitamins A, C and E do the same by preventing the build up of plaque and the blockage of blood flow in arteries. Magnesium and potassium are the main minerals that help with blood pressure and heart function by supporting muscle and nerve function. Iron is needed to deliver oxygen to tissues all over the body. Eating chard regularly also has the potential to lower high levels of cholesterol and blood sugar, mainly from its fiber content. Chard also helps the body activate crucial antioxidant molecules from the liver to help get rid of potentially dangerous metabolic wastes. Studies also suggest regular eating of vegetables like chard can slow down age-related cognitive decline. The long list of benefits shows chard is a flat out supporter of overall health.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Swiss-Chard-iStock-638684806.jpg
Tarragon,"You can gain the many health benefits of tarragon by using teas, dried/fresh leaves, the essential oil and tinctures. (Tarragon mixed with isopropyl alcohol makes a good disinfectant.) Tarragon contains caffeic acid, which can stop or kill many bacteria, viruses and fungi. It makes a good cleansing disinfectant to rub on wounds or can be used as a deodorant. Components of tarragon help digestion by stimulating the secretion of digestive compounds in the saliva as well as gastric fluids (like bile and other acids) into the lower digestive tract. This stimulates faster processing of foods already in the stomach (which helps get rid of wastes and potential toxins faster) and increases appetite. Its antimicrobial action enables tarragon to kill intestinal worms. Tarragon also increases circulation, which helps distribute nutrients, oxygen, hormones and enzymes to tissues and remove toxins. Tarragon has calming properties, too. Many people use it to help relax the nerves and facilitate a good night’s sleep. Despite these health benefits, use in moderation. Tarragon oil contains estragole, which is toxic at high levels. As an extra precaution, young children and pregnant women should avoid the oil. The spice is safe, as the essential oil concentrations are too small to cause harm.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Tarragon-iStock-965385372.jpg
Thyme,"Thyme is a healthy source of vitamin K, giving more than 60 percent of RDA in two teaspoons. It also contains iron, manganese, calcium and dietary fiber. It is an old-time remedy for chest and respiratory illness. The benefits come from the essential oils and flavonoids, which have antioxidant, antifungal and antibacterial functions. The oil thymol has antioxidant powers that help increase the good fats in cells and their membranes. It also works as an antibacterial agent against Salmonella, E. coli, Shigella and others. You can create your own surface cleaning/disinfectant spray by mixing thyme, boiling water and a little liquid soap in a spray bottle.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Thyme-iStock-1323000329.jpg
Tomato,"A great supporter of overall health. Tomatoes have a lot of vitamins C and A, plus beta-carotene and the pigment lycopene, all super antioxidants that help prevent cell damage by free radical oxygen molecules. These phytonutrients work in synergy with other vitamins and minerals in tomatoes to promote heart and bone health and protect against inflammation and a number of cancers. (The cardiovascular benefits come from helping to regulate blood pressure and reduce damage to blood vessels from oxidative stress, plaque buildup and elevated homocysteine levels.) Regularly eating tomatoes can lower cholesterol levels, promote proper fetal development and regulate blood sugar. The B vitamins help make use of the energy in food.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Tomato-iStock-147250592.jpg
Turnips,"Turnip roots are high in Vitamin C. With the greens, their high content of vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients are a great promoter of overall health. Turnips and turnip greens help create more bone mass by slowing osteoclastic (break down) processes and increasing osteoblastic (building) processes. Turnips and their greens are loaded with vitamins A, C and E, which reinforce immune system, maintain healthy membranes and connective tissue (for example, blood vessels and joints), protect important cells (eyes and vascular system) from free radical damage and reduce inflammation. Turnips also give dietary fiber that helps maintain healthy digestion and regulates cholesterol levels. Along with the free radical fighters, fiber promotes overall health and efficient functioning of the colon. Turnips and their greens also support heart health. The antioxidants (vitamins C, A and E) directly protect the structure and function of blood vessels and minimize the buildup of plaque on vessel walls. Vitamins B6 and folate also prevent damage to vessel walls by minimizing the potentially harmful chemical homocysteine. This vegetable also supports healthy metabolism, lung health and brain function.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Turnips-iStock-1370545708.jpg
Walnuts,"They lack many common vitamins and minerals, but walnuts have profound phytonutrients for your health. They are a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, an essential fat the body cannot make. Omega-3’s in walnuts help protect the heart, have anti-inflammatory properties, encourage healthy brain function and help prevent many cancers. An omega-3 found in walnuts is also linked to healthy bones. Walnuts are high in fats, but these are good fats linked to lowering the risk of weight gain. They also have monounsaturated fats, which reduce the bad form of cholesterol (LDL) and the threat of clotting in arteries. Walnuts also have arginine, an essential amino acid the body cannot produce. This amino acid helps maintain smooth and elastic blood vessel walls by helping produce nitric oxide, which relaxes the smooth muscle around blood vessels. Walnuts also have many antioxidants that keep free radicals from damaging cells, especially in the cardiovascular system. Eating walnuts regularly is linked to a decrease in blood pressure. Walnuts can actually undo some of the damaging biochemical reactions caused by eating foods high in saturated fats. Cell membranes are made of fats. Introducing flexible omega-3 fatty acids increases a cell membrane’s flexibility and ability to communicate and excrete wastes. This is especially important in the brain, helping us grow closer to our full cognitive potential. Walnuts give melatonin, an antioxidant that also supports healthy biorhythms. Together all these factors make walnuts a heart-smart choice.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Walnuts-iStock-1058321136.jpg
Watercress,"An excellent source of vitamin K and a good source of calcium, watercress helps maintain strong bones and healthy blood clotting. It also donates about half the RDA of both antioxidant vitamins A (also in the form of beta carotene) and C. These are key factors in protecting cells and organs from oxidative damage by free radicals. They also help support a healthy immune response, eyesight, skin and cardiovascular system (by preventing plaque build up and maintaining elasticity in blood vessel walls). Watercress also has small amounts of vitamins B1, B6, E and the minerals magnesium, iron, iodine and zinc. These support the thyroid gland, stimulate metabolism, synthesize red blood cells and stimulate the production of antibodies to fight infections. Watercress has the phytonutrients lutein and zeaxanthin, which work alongside beta-carotene and vitamin A to maintain healthy eyesight. The glucosinolates help boost and regulate the liver’s production of detoxification enzymes. The phenylethyl isothiocyanates in watercress are being studied for their potential to fight the development of cancer cells.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Watercress-iStock-647809708.jpg
Watermelon,"Watermelon packs a punch with important vitamins and phytonutrients. The combination of antioxidant vitamins C and A does wonders for the body. They both stop free radicals from causing damage to cells that otherwise lead to many ailments: plaque build up in arteries through the oxidation of cholesterol, increased inflammation, especially in joints, vision deterioration and cellular damage that can lead to mutations in DNA (which can become cancerous). Watermelon is also a great source of the phytonutrient lycopene, which has received much attention for its antioxidant behavior and ability to reduce the risk of many cancers. Watermelon is also a great fruit source of B vitamins, which the body uses to generate energy from sugars, carbohydrates, lipids (fats), amino acids and proteins. Another phytonutrient, citrulline (an amino acid, too) gets converted to the amino acid arginine. Higher levels of arginine are linked to relaxing blood vessels (through increased production of nitric oxide) removing the waste product ammonia and increasing cell sensitivity to the insulin molecule.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Watermelon-iStock-1496179914.jpg
Wheatgrass,"Wheatgrass juice or powder is a great low-calorie addition to the diet. It gives substantial vitamin C, iron and phytonutrients with little risk of adverse effects and a high potential for benefit. Within alternative medicine, wheatgrass has its strong proponents who tout its strength and versatility as a remedy. Some say wheatgrass gives them energy (by increasing metabolism), helps improve oxygen delivery to the cells (due to chlorophyll acting like hemoglobin in blood), boosts their immune system, helps improve skin conditions and wound healing (when drunk and applied topically), inhibits cancer cell development (especially liver cancer from the chlorophyll content), treats ulcerative colitis (inflammation of the colon), treats arthritis, prevents tooth decay (by holding in the mouth for 5 minutes), relieves constipation, detoxifies the blood (through high antioxidant behavior), decreases blood pressure and improves digestion. Little research has been done to support these statements. Still, give it a try and see how it makes you feel.",https://drearth.com/wp-content/uploads/Wheatgrass-iStock-940552070.jpg
